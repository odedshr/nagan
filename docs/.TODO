Using Proxy for state and event management
events, if needed are set into the proxy "lastEvent" variable with designated type
type=notifications issues toast notifications
Using barebone JSX to create dynamic HTMLs
big components are form that can be submitted so actions are handled on the onsubmit event instead of per-button
Dynamic lists are component that can be replaced when the lists is updated. The List component is then injected to the form component so no rewiring is needed if the lists is updated
components can notify for change in 3 ways
update the state, if they have access to it,
 use a delegate method
button-click to be catched by surrounding form
modals - Yes/No, prompt, dialog
Dialog is Modal(Component(resolve,reject))
ConfirmComponent
PromptComponent
